		## About

		A stylized track map showing all cars and their position (car number if no time/position is set) on track or in pits. Tracks are based on [RivalTracker by Sam Hazim](https://github.com/SamHazim/RivalTracker) with many of them redrawn and missing tracks for iRacing added.

		## Setup

		1. Go to [Settings](#!/settings) page
		2. Copy generated **CLR Browser URL**
		3. In OBS add new **CLR Browser** layer, and paste it in **URL**
		4. Set **Dimensions** to `Width: 420` and `Height: 324`

		   *While these are the exact dimensions of the map and work out of the box most of the time it happens in some cases that the map is still cut off. It is not known what might cause this. In that case use larger dimensions to compensate.*
